\subsection{Energy Crisis, Energy Security and Climate Change}

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) explains, in its latest report, that humans and nature are being pushed beyond their abilities to adapt due to the anthropogenic emissions caused by economic, industrial and societal activities~\cite{IPCC2022Portner}. Nowadays, carbon-intensive resources still comprise a large proportion of the energy system~\cite{IPCC2022Portner} – about 80\% in 2017~\cite{raturi2019renewables}. However, the share of electricity production from renewables increased from 20.8\% to 29.0\% between 1985 and 2020~\cite{BP2021bp}. Still, carbon emissions have not been reduced in line with the ambitions of the Paris Agreement, and it is predicted that in the next few years, the gains in carbon reduction due to the COVID-19 pandemic will be erased, faster than expected~\cite{WEO2021IEA}. However, even under all these pressures and projections, it is still possible for humanity to keep the global temperature below 1.5°C from pre-industrial levels by 2100 if substantial changes are made to the current energy systems.

On the other hand, energy security is an important part of the countries’ strategies to support economic growth and provide essential services to their populations. Currently, nations deposit most of their energy security onto fossil fuels while expanding their renewable power capacity. Fossil fuels and their conversion systems (e.g. internal combustion engines) permit operators to react quickly to changes in the energy demand (i.e. more control over the energy deployment) while offering acceptable volumetric energy densities. However, countries’ heavy reliance on fossil fuels coupled with the fuel’s geographical origin is at the mercy of important price fluctuations due to geopolitical and logistical events, such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. These can disrupt energy systems and affect a country’s stability and human livelihoods~\cite{bhattacharyya2009fossil,russiagas}. On the other hand, renewable energy production and distribution tend to be within the country's boundaries. During the last few years, its price has been catching those of the subsidised fossil fuels – with some specific examples already undercutting fossil fuel prices~\cite{IRENA2021Renewable}. In fact, from 1987 to 2015, the cost of oil and coal rose by approximately 36\% and 81\%, respectively and from 1989 to 2015, the cost of natural gas rose by approximately 53\%~\cite{BP2016bp}. Lately, in the UK, the natural gas price during March 2022 has increased to around £5.40/therm, a rise above 1,100\% from the price levels seen in 2021~\cite{T2022UKNatureGas}. Still, it is important to mention that renewable energy variability and investment requirements are significant challenges toward grid stability and energy security.

\subsection{Shipping Sector, Small-Boat Fleet and Emission Inventory}
Shipping, the backbone of market globalisation, plays an important role in the carbon reduction of human activities since it moves around 90\% of the goods around the globe~\cite{walker2019environmental}. However, shipping reliance on fossil fuels coupled with a robust economic growth saw shipping total \ch{CO2} emissions grow from 962 Mt in 2012 to 1,056 Mt in 2018, which represented more than 10\% of the total global transportation emissions ~\cite{IMO2021Fourth}. Further, if nothing is done in the sector, it was projected that by 2050 shipping \ch{CO2} emissions could grow up to 1,500 Mt. In this light, the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) produced its ambitions to decarbonise international shipping~\cite{imo2018adoption} in 2018. However, this vision only covers international navigation composed of large vessels, and it misses the small boat fleet – vessels below 100 gross tonnages, which tend to measure less than 24 m in length~\cite{uk2021Operational}.

But there are good reasons for that. First, the IMO focuses mainly on ships that navigate on international waters or large ships performing domestic voyages. These vessels are required to have the Automatic Identification System (AIS) transponders for safe navigation. On the other hand, small boats tend not to have an AIS or GPS transponder, making studying their movements challenging. Second, they are typically registered and monitored by national and regional bodies, and the comprehensiveness depends on the capital and human resources plus the infrastructure to maintain the registry. Third, small boats are a diverse segment of shipping which is built, and usage depends on the geographical location, type of activity, cost of building and operating, and accessibility to fuel or bunkering infrastructure. Similarly, engine providers are extensive, giving a broad range of fuel consumption curves and emissions.

Furthermore, the fuel selection is equally diverse: petrol, diesel, petrol mixed with engine oil – mainly for two-stroke engines, ethanol and bio-fuels – or a mix of bio-fuel with different fossil fuels. Finally, on this matter, not all the small boats are powered by an internal combustion engine. Instead, they can be powered by sail, battery-electric or paddles.

Still, under all these challenges, the small boat fleet can significantly estimate this shipping segment's emission footprint based on its activity. Emissions inventories can help understand what measures need to be taken to enable governments and the industry to start the road to full decarbonization in a just and equitable way. Further, creating effective policies and regulations based on accurate emissions accounting can incentivize the use of energy-efficient technologies, electrification and scalable zero-emission fuels. Additionally, if countries want to meet their ambitious decarbonization emissions targets, they cannot afford to ignore the small boat fleet GHG role.

Although it is possible to estimate emissions from large vessels using satellite data sent from the ship's transponder to be coupled with technical models~\cite{IMO2021Fourth}, the small vessels depend on the national registration system. Their operation is typically assumed or captured by national fuel sales, which tend to be highly aggregated (e.g. ~\cite{sener2018balance}). Developed economies such as the UK tend to have a national registry of the smaller vessels~\cite{uk2021registration} that allows a sense of the activity level and hence infer the \ch{CO2} emissions.

However, in developing countries, it tends to be a mixed bag on the level of precision and availability. For instance, in Mexico, only fishing vessels are counted in the registry ~\cite{Mexico2021RegisteredVessels}. Still, it is not easy to know where they are located and infer their activities. Besides, the rest of the small-boat categories are not registered. In all, Mexico does not have a regional \ch{CO2} inventory specialised in the small-boat fleet; instead, they are aggregated as part of the \textit{maritime and fluvial navigation [1A3d]} class in the national annual emission inventory developed by the Instituto Nacional de Ecología y Cambio Climático (INECC)~\cite{inecc2020inventario} in a top-down approach recommended by the IPCC~\cite{eggleston20062006}. Therefore, quantifying and categorising the small-boat fleet will allow a better precision of where and how the emissions are being emitted and will better understand the maritime emission inventory.

Observing the shipping activity in the Gulf of California is essential due to its unique geographical location, conformation, and biophysical environment~\cite{LLUCHCOTA20071}~\cite{munguia2018ecological}~\cite{MARINONE2012133}. Furthermore, in the Gulf of California, there is the largest fishing state (Sonora) in Mexico~\cite{MELTZER2006222} and the most prominent sports fishing destination (Los Cabos, Baja)~\cite{hernandez2012economic}. Besides, it is one of the regions in Mexico with the most protected areas due to the flora and fauna diversity, such as the upper part of the Gulf of California, Bahia Loreto and Bahia de los Angeles~\cite{CNANP2022Atlas, SMARN2022Islas}. 



\subsection{Bringing Deep Learning to Small Ships Detection in Satellite Images}
Bringing deep learning, especially convolutional neural networks, to the field of satellite image recognition is essential. First, the technological barriers that satellite image recognition requires gradually decrease with time. As the quality and quantity of global satellite images improve, obtaining the same or even better detection results with reduced parameters and complexity of convolutional neural networks is possible. Second, satellite image recognition is not new. For example, scholars at the University of Texas at Austin have been using machine learning and remote sensing imagery to discover undersea shipwrecks successfully~\cite{character2021archaeologic}. However, finding submarine wrecks does not require algorithms to describe the location and size of the wreck very precisely, as opposed to identifying small boats and their physical characteristics. Therefore, in this study, accurately identifying and measuring the dimensions of small ships is a current challenge and an essential objective of this work.


\subsection{Contributions}
The contributions of this study are summarised as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A purposely-built methodology for this work, BoatNet, was developed. This work shows that BoatNet detects many small boats in low-resolution, blurry satellite images with considerable noise levels. As a result, the precision of training can be up to 93.9\%, and detecting small boats in the Gulf of California can be up to 74.0\%.

    \item This work demonstrated that BoatNet could detect the length of small boats with a precision up to 99.0\%.

    \item BoatNet has allowed us better to understand the small boat activity and physical characteristics. Based on this, it has been possible to answer questions about the composition of small boats in the Gulf of California. Regarding the authors' knowledge of the literature, this is the first but essential step in constructing a way to estimate the maritime carbon footprint of the small boat fleet.
